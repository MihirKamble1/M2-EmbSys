# 1. About Smart Home
 * Description
   
   It is a embedded system where user can control the home appliance using his mobile phone with the help of the bluetooth moduleand sensors will be interfaced with the microcontrollers which will help the microcontroller to attatin the goal of this product.

 * Features :
  
    User will be able to access the appliances using bluetooth and also with the help of sensors and configured by the user the appliances will act accordingly even if user input is not given at that time.

 * SWOT Analysis :
  
  * Strength:

    The major strength of this project is that it is easy to operate and the sensors are well calibrated with the microcontroller which leads to efficint work.

  * Weakness:

    The weakness of this project is that the motion sensor used does not recognize who the person is standing infront of the motion sensor.

    Another weakness of this project is if the person is not feeling well and does not need the AC to turn on there is no way that the microcontroller will know about this and will result in turning on the AC even though the person or user is not well.
  * Opportunities:

    It can be used to build an ecosystem in a house where you dont need to worry abot the electricity and and any other things it controller will take care of it.
  * Threats:

    As it does not recognizes the person it is the biggest threats.
  * 5Ws & 1 H
   * Who :

     It is about the embedded system which makes our life easy applying concepts of embedded track and creating an well synced ecosystem.

   * What :
    
     As we are going towards the digital era, everything is becoming automated, literally we dont need to get up from the bed to turn off fan today not only this there are alot of examples of this automation and this gives a good motivation to make something in it. 
  
   * Who :
     As it is a smart home it controls home appliance at one click and with the help of sensors it is for everyone it does not target specific class of people.
   
   * When :

     I will we alone working on this project and at second week of march it will be delivered.

   * Where :

     It will be displayed commercially to make your home a well synced ecosystem, everything will be alligned and furthur development will also be there. 

   * How :
     We will use microcontroller to do this task, programming will be used to interface microcontroller and sensors will be used to get a signals from surrounding and by this our task will be acheived.


# 2. Requirements
## High Level Requirements :

| HLR1  | The AC should turn on after sensing the environment Temperature |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| HLR2  | The door should open when the bluetooth signal is given         | 
| HLR3  | The light must turn off if no one is there                      |
| HLR4  | The user must have the access to the appliance even though he is not at home |

## Low Level Requirements:
|LLR1   | The microcontroller should compare the user input and ambient temp and act accordingly |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|LLR2   | If the user dont wants to turn on light the light must remain off                      |
|LLR3   | If the user doest feel well and dont want to decrease the temp and also not turn on the AC|
|LLR4   | If the user is not himself there but wants the system to open door and turn on lights and turn on AC also for Family member it should be taken care|
